3) Maximum speed limit: The ego vehicle must not exceed the speed limit. The maximum speed is 43.0 m/s.
Here is an overview of all relevant obstacles surrounding you:
    - car 19416: It is driving on the same lane and is 66.9 meters behind you. Its velocity is 12.5 m/s, orientation is 2.550 rad, steering angle is 0.000 rad, and acceleration is 0.0 m/s². The time-to-collision is inf sec.
    - truck 19427: It is driving on the right-adjacent lane in the same direction and is 93.1 meters behind you. Its velocity is 12.2 m/s, orientation is 2.556 rad, steering angle is 0.000 rad, and acceleration is 0.0 m/s². The time-to-collision is inf sec.

DEU_MONAEast-2_25532_T-25557,16317,"You are driving a car and need to make a high-level driving decision.
First, carefully observe the environment.
Then, reason through your decision step by step and present it in natural language.
Finally, return the top 3 advisable longitudinal–lateral action pairs, ranked from best to worst.
Feasible longitudinal actions:
  - accelerate
  - decelerate
  - keep
  - stop
Feasible lateral actions:
  - follow_lane
No past actions recorded. Here is an overview of your environment:
There is no left-adjacent lane. There is no right-adjacent lane. 
Your velocity is 15.4 m/s, orientation is -0.541 rad, steering angle is 0.000 rad, and acceleration is 0.0 m/s².
Please adhere to the traffic regulations in Germany:
